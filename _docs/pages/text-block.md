      Dear friend,
      <br><br>
      I have no memory of the accident and I&#8217;m told that&#8217;s probably a good thing. I was riding my bike to work on a Thursday morning last January when a bus collided with me&#8212;and then I was hit by a dump truck.
      <br><br>
      My first memory of that day is waking up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) with a team of doctors and nurses around me. I was suffering from severe lower limb trauma and they had a very short amount of time to save my leg&#8230;and I&#8217;m so happy to report that they did!
      <br><br>
      I never thought I would need emergency help from VGH&#8212;until that scary day when I wouldn&#8217;t have survived without it. Thanks to donors like you, I received incredible care from the moment I was admitted to VGH and throughout my recovery at UBC Hospital and GF Strong Rehab Centre.
      <br><br>
      You and I and all of our fellow British Columbians are lucky to have these health care centres in case the unexpected and life-threatening happens.
      <br><br>
      <span style="color:#84c447;font-weight:700">Please donate to support the team of people who got me up and walking on my own two legs again.</span>
      <br><br>
      Sincerely.
      <br><br>
    </p>
