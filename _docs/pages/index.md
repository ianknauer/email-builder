## Before you start

The foundation uses Luminate as our main tool for email communication with our donors. This guide serve as an update to date resource for how we're building emails. Every time the wrappers/components change, we'll be updating this documentation to make sure it's up to date.

## Email Wrappers

The wrappers (or in Luminate terms "stationary") are specific to how Luminate deals with emails. When building an email you initially choose the stationary and then fill in the rest with the content. The wrappers provide the HTML/CSS that is meant to be shared across a bunch of different emails. The foundation information

<div class="row up-1 medium-up-2 large-up-3 docs-big-index">
  <div class="column"><a href="template-bordered.html">
    <strong>Bordered Wrapper</strong>
    <p>This is the wrapper that includes the border around the content.</p>
  </a></div>
  <div class="column"><a href="template-regular.html">
    <strong>Regular Wrapper</strong>
    <p>This is the wrapper that doesn't include the border.</p>
  </a></div>
</div>

## Prebuilt Templates

We have a selection of templates to use that were originally built by the contractors who implemented Laminate for us. These have all been tested fully across different email clients and are the suggested way to start building out emails.

<div class="row up-1 medium-up-2 large-up-3 docs-big-index">
  <div class="column"><a href="sass.html">
    <strong>E-Appeal</strong>
    <p>This is the most commonly used template, meant to be used for fundraising appeal type emails.<br><br><br>Includes the following components:
    <ul><li>Donate Callout</li><li>Header</li><li>Quote</li><li>Signature</li><li>Social buttons</li></ul>
    </a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="column"><a href="inky.html">
    <strong>E-News</strong>
    <p>This template is more image heavy and is meant for newsletters. Currently built around having 3 stories, 1 main and 2 secondary.
    <br><br>Includes the following components:
    <ul><li>Logo button</li><li>images</li><li>text block</li></ul>
    </a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="column"><a href="inky.html">
    <strong>Invitation</strong>
    <p>This is similar to the E-Appeal, but includes components that are focused around bringing people to an event rather than donating.
    <br><br>Includes the following components:
    <ul><li>header</li><li>Event Info</li><li>text block</li><li>RSVP</li><li>Social Media</li></ul>
    </a></p>
  </div>
</div>

## Components

These are the smaller sections that make up our emails. If you're looking to send out an email that doesn't fit in one of the prebuilt templates, you can build your own using these components. All components work within either of the wrappers.
